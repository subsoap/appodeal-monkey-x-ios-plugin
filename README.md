# appodeal-monkey-x-ios-plugin

To add Appodeal ads to your iOS target Monkey project, you should download this plugin and add folder "appodeal" to your project folder "modules". See the example in this git for how this is to be done in a Monkey project.

After that you should build your project in Ted or another Monkey friendly IDE to convert your app to XCode project.
If you see error like this: 
```
MonkeyXPro78h/modules/appodeal/appodeal_example.buildv78h/ios/main.mm:4290:9: fatal error: 'Appodeal/Appodeal.h' file not found
#import "Appodeal/Appodeal.h"
```
Do not worry - this will be fixed in the next steps.

After making the target build with Monkey, you should next open the generated XCode project and make some changes:

1. Type bundle identifier, current version of app and choose Provisioning profile for successful debug.

3. Set up the following keys in your appâ€™s info.plist:

```
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
  <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
```

Add this key in Info.plist, if you use these functions in your app

```
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>Advertising</string>
<key>NSCalendarsUsageDescription</key>
<string>Advertising</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>Advertising</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Advertising</string>
```

4. Change deployment target in project settings and target settings to 8.1 or higher.

5. Add "libz.tbd", "libc++.tbd", "libsqlite3.tbd", "libxml2.2" libraries to Build phases->Link Binary With Libraries.

6. Add "Appodeal.framework" and lib Resources to your project.

First, download Appodeal SDK from here: http://bit.ly/ios-sdk-1-3-9

After downloading unzip archive. Drag and drop Appodeal.framework into your project. Then right click on your project (MonkeyGame), click New Group, name it Resources, and then drag and drop the files from the Resources folder into the Resources group in your project. When dragging and dropping files both times you should check "Copy items if needed" option. If done properly you should be able to see at least 32 items in your Copy Bundle Resources list of the Build Phases tab.

All done, now you can launch your project in XCode.
